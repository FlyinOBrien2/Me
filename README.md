# Me

Hey, I'm Kendall, and I'm super new to github.  It feels good to be part of such a cool community!

I'm currently working my way through the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum and I'm having a lot of fun with all of the learning and challenges.  I've been interested in programming for several years now and I'm considering trying to make it my career.  I have one more challenge for both the Responsive Web Design Cert as well as the JS cert.  It feels great to finally be putting a lot of effort into becoming more proficient with programming.

Iâ€™m currently learning HTML/CSS/JS.  I have a little bit of experience with Java and Android App development, nothing too serious, just a few projects I've created for my own device and some friend's.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that improve people's lives.  I want to learn more about a lot of things/languages some of which include - more Java, Python, back end development, Arduino.
